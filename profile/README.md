 ### Web3 Integration:

### 🔗 [Celestia](https://celestia.org) – Modular Blockchain Technology
Celestia's modular blockchain architecture is fundamental to Horizen's scalability and security:

- **Data Availability Layer**: We utilize Celestia's data availability layer to ensure that all NFT metadata and transaction data are securely stored and easily accessible.
- **Scalability**: Celestia's modular design allows us to process a high volume of NFT transactions without compromising on speed or efficiency.
- **Custom Execution Environments**: We've implemented specialized execution environments for different types of NFTs (e.g., artwork, videos, music), optimizing performance for each content type.

### ⛽ [Gelato](https://www.gelato.network) – Decentralized Automation and Gasless Transactions
Gelato's automation network significantly enhances user experience and reduces friction in NFT transactions:
- **Gasless Transactions**: We've implemented gasless minting and trading of NFTs, allowing users to interact with the platform without worrying about gas fees.
- **Automated Royalty Payments**: Smart contract automation ensures creators receive royalties instantly upon secondary sales.

Implementation examples:
- Integration of Gelato's SDK in our smart contracts

### 📦 [Pinata](https://app.pinata.cloud) – IPFS Storage for NFTs and Media
Pinata's IPFS solution provides a decentralized and reliable storage system for all NFT-related content:
- **NFT Metadata Storage**: All metadata for NFTs is stored on IPFS through Pinata, ensuring immutability and decentralized access.
- **Media Content Delivery**: High-quality images and videos associated with NFTs are stored and served via Pinata's IPFS nodes.
- **Content Persistence**: We use Pinata's pinning service to ensure long-term availability of all NFT content.

Implementation examples:
- IPFS content hashing and uploading
- Integration with Pinata API for pinning management 

This powerful stack enables **Horizen** to provide an exceptional decentralized NFT and video experience. 🚀
